## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 24.04 or higher
- Root access to your server
- Fresh VPS installation recommended

### One-Line Installation

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexwinds/nexdb/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This will:
1. Check if your system meets the requirements (Ubuntu 24+)
2. Install MySQL 8 and configure it securely
3. Set up NEXDB with an admin account
4. Configure the database connection
5. Display the access credentials when complete

## üîß Configuration

All configuration can be managed through the NEXDB dashboard after installation. 

### PostgreSQL Installation

PostgreSQL can be installed directly from the system dashboard:

1. Navigate to "System" ‚Üí "Dashboard"
2. In the "Services Status" section, find the PostgreSQL row
3. If PostgreSQL is not installed, click the "Install PostgreSQL" button
4. The system will install PostgreSQL, configure it with secure defaults, and display the credentials
5. These credentials will be automatically saved in the NEXDB configuration

The PostgreSQL installation process:
- Installs PostgreSQL server and client packages
- Starts and enables the PostgreSQL service
- Sets a secure random password for the 'postgres' user
- Automatically configures NEXDB to connect to the local PostgreSQL server

### AWS S3 Backup Configuration

Configure S3 backups in the dashboard:

1. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Backup Configuration"
2. Enter your AWS credentials and bucket details
3. Save the configuration

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Guide

### Database Explorer

1. **Browsing Databases and Tables**
   - Navigate to "DB Explorer" from the main menu
   - Select database type (MySQL/PostgreSQL) from the dropdown
   - Choose a database from the sidebar
   - Browse tables in the selected database

2. **Viewing and Editing Table Data**
   - Click on any table name to view its contents
   - Use search box to filter records
   - Sort columns by clicking column headers
   - Edit records with the edit button
   - Add new records with the "Add Record" button

3. **Running SQL Queries**
   - Click "Run SQL Query" button
   - Write your SQL query in the editor
   - Press Execute or Ctrl+Enter to run
   - View results in the table below

### Backup Management

1. **Creating a Manual Backup**
   - Go to "Backups" section
   - Select database to backup
   - Choose destination (local/S3)
   - Click "Create Backup"

2. **Setting Up Scheduled Backups**
   - Configure backup schedule
   - Set retention period
   - Select databases to include
   - Enable/disable compressed backups

## üí° Best Practices

- **Security**
  - Always access NEXDB via HTTPS in production
  - Use strong passwords for admin access
  - Regularly update your NEXDB installation

- **Backups**
  - Schedule regular automated backups
  - Test restore functionality periodically
  - Use off-site S3 backups for critical databases

- **Performance**
  - Monitor system resource usage
  - Optimize large queries before execution
  - Schedule backups during low-usage periods

## üîí Security Considerations

- Single-user authentication system with secure password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256)
- CSRF tokens protect against cross-site request forgery
- All user inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection
- Optional IP restriction for additional security

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- Docker deployment option with docker-compose
- Multi-admin role support with different permission levels
- Advanced monitoring with alerting capabilities
- Support for additional database types (MongoDB, SQLite)
- Additional cloud backup providers (Google Cloud, Azure)
- Customizable dashboard widgets
